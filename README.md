# Project 6

Project 6 includes an app that utilizes fragments, a recycler view and Room Database to allow users to add, edit and delete notes.

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

  - The home screen displays a list of titles of notes
  - Each note has a delete button to its right, when clicked it will         pop-up a dialog and confirm if the user wants to delete or not
  - On the click of a note title, the note will be opened and the title      and description can be edited and saved with the help of the save        button
  - The add note button allows user to create a new note
  - If a new note is created but is blank or is exited without clicking      the save button, the note will not be deleted
  - Each note has a title and a description

## Extensions

Potential extensions include:
  - User authentication using sign-up and log-in feature to securely to      access their notes
  - Shows an excerpt of the note description along with the title
  - Implement a search feature that allows users to search for specific      words or phrases within the notes
